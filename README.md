Atlas Examples
==============
This is a repository for Atlas examples.


Authentication
--------------
You will need an access token, which can be generated in your account page in
[Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/settings/tokens?utm_source=github&utm_medium=examples&utm_campaign=readme). All
CLIs and libraries respect the `ATLAS_TOKEN` environment variable, so you can
add the token to your `.shellrc`.


Writing Examples
----------------
Pretty simple - create a folder named after the example. Add a README if there
is setup required, and add supporting files.


Issues
------
To report issues (such as typographical errors or confusion) in these examples,
please open a GitHub issue. **For Atlas-specific support, please email
[support@hashicorp.com](mailto:support@hashicorp.com).**


Documentation
------------
Additional documentation on Atlas, Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, and Consul can be [read here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/help#documentation).
